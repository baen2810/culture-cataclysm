# Cataclysm - A Culture Project

This is Cataclysm - my fan-fiction novel set in Iain M. Bank’s Culture universe.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Culture is my secular heaven, the place I’d like to live.</em></p>
While this quote originates from Iain's work, specifically from the collection 'The Culture – The Drawings', it aptly encapsulates my profound fascination for the incredibly credible universe he crafted.
At the time of finishing this book – mid 2024 –, I firmly believe it is the AI utopia we all need to hear and think about. I would be gratified if my homage to Iain's masterpiece inspires more individuals to explore his literary works.
